## Plan
Learn something new on my own.  
Explore testing Javascript using Jasmine framework.  
Test Drive recreation of FizzBuzz challenge in Javascript.  
Create code that is easy to read and understand.  

## User Story
```
As a User
So I can find out if a number is Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz
I would like to input a number in a web app and find out
```

## How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/learningtocode101/fizzbuzz_js.git
cd fizzbuzz_js
open index.html 
```
## Approach to learning
1. I started out this challenge having understood the requirements from when it was first created using Ruby.  
2. I applied the same problem solving methodology but using Javascript language, learning the basic syntax and then researching additional concepts as and when needed.    
3. Having an understanding of the problem I employed Red-Green-Refactor approach i.e. creating tests, watching them fail and then implementing code to pass the tests then refactoring code to ensure it was DRY.
