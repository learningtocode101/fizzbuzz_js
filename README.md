Recreation of FizzBuzz challenge in Javascript 

## How to use

```
## Approach to learning
I started out this challenge having understood the requirements from when it was first created using Ruby.  
I then applied the same problem solving methodology but using Javascript language.  
Having an understanding of the problem I employed  Red-Green-Refactor approach  
 Created tests that failed and then implemented code using conditional statements to check the number divisbility and added statement to be executed if condidition is met.  
Passed test and then commited.    
Repeated process for each condition of the problem.  
After successfully completing, I then refactored code so it is easy to read and understanding.
