## Approach to learning
1. I started out this challenge having understood the requirements from when it was first created using Ruby.  
2. I applied the same problem solving methodology but using Javascript language, researching as and when need.    
3. Having an understanding of the problem I employed Red-Green-Refactor approach i.e. creating tests, watching them fail and then implementing code to pass the tests then refactoring code to ensure it was DRY.
